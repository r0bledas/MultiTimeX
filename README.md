# MultiTimeX

MultiTimeX is a simple and intuitive iOS app designed to help you keep track of time until a specified target. While the native iOS Clock app provides basic timer functionality, it lacks the ability to set countdowns to specific future times with a clear visual progress indicator. MultiTimeX fills this gap by offering a clean and user-friendly interface to manage your countdowns.

## Features

- **Target Time Selection**: Easily select a target time using a wheel-style date picker. Choose between today or tomorrow to set your countdown.
- **Real-Time Countdown**: Displays the remaining time in a large, easy-to-read format, updated in real-time.
- **Progress Visualization**: Includes a progress bar and percentage display to visualize how much time has passed.
- **Start/Stop Functionality**: Simple controls to start and stop the countdown timer.
- **Vibration Alert**: Notifies you with a vibration when the countdown reaches zero.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Designed with a clean and modern UI, ensuring a seamless user experience.
- **Made by Ra-Rauw!**: A personal touch with a signature at the bottom of the app.
